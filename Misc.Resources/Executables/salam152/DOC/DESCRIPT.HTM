<B>Introduction</B><BR>
The aim of the following document is to introduce functions and behavior of
Servant Salamander. The program itself was designed to be user-friendly,
therefore advanced users should be able to use it without reading any
instructions. Yet we recommend that even they go through the following text
to get an overview of program capabilities.

<A NAME="Appearance">
<B>Appearance</B><BR>
The main window of Servant Salamander is divided into three subwindows. Two
panels with directory listings are side by side, and a system command line is
at the bottom. Both panels are further divided into three subwindows - a
directory line, a list of directories and files, and an information line. For
a better understanding see the screenshot of the
main window.
<P>

The directory line contains the change drive button, the current directory name,
and the free space on the current drive or network volume. Click the left mouse
button on the change drive button to open menu with available drives and Network
Neighborhood, and the right mouse button to display context menu for the current
directory. If the current drive or network volume doesn't support change
notifications, automatic refresh of the list won't work, and the mark of
exclamation is shown at the beginning of the directory line. The list of
directories and files contains all wanted directories and files from the current
directory. You can apply filters to this list and also choose if you want to see
hidden and system directories and files. You can choose from two forms of this
list - a brief form and a detailed form. The list in the brief form contains
only names in columns (left panel in
the main window screenshot).
The list in the detailed form contains all information about each directory and
file (right panel in the main window screenshot).
The information line contains all information about the focused file or directory.
<P>
Each name in the list has a small graphical symbol for better orientation.
There are special symbols for directories, executable files, associated files,
and other files. Shared directories are marked by symbol of an open hand. Servant
Salamander can also show the default icons provided by the system instead of
these simple symbols. See
the screenshot with the system icons.
<P>
For customization of the appearance, see menus Left, Options, and Right, the
tab Panels in the Configuration dialog, and the Customize Colors dialog
(on the tab General in the Configuration dialog). The split-line between
panels can be positioned by mouse dragging. Double-click the left mouse button
on the split-line to return it to the original position.
<P>

<A NAME="System Command Line">
<B>System Command Line</B><BR>
You can switch to the command line with Ctrl+Tab key, and with the same key or
ESC key you can switch back to the panels. When the command line became active,
you can type any command for the system shell, and then execute it with the
Enter key. To insert the focused file or directory name from the panel to
such command, use Ctrl+Enter key. Similarly, to insert the full current path
from the left or right panel, use Ctrl+[ or Ctrl+] key.
<P>
On the tab General in the Configuration dialog, you can choose if the system
command shell window should be closed after execution of the command. If you
execute the command with Alt+Enter key, this setting for the command will be
inverted.
<P>
The last thirty executed commands are stored in a command line history. Use
Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down keys to scroll in this history. If the command line is
active, and you need to switch to some other directory or execute some file
in the panel, use Shift+Enter key or Enter key if command line is empty
(ie. there is nothing to execute).
<P>

<A NAME="Quick Search">
<B>Quick Search</B><BR>
You can quickly find any desired name in the list of directories and files. Just
start typing a name, and the first name with the typed prefix will be focused.
You can extend this prefix with Right arrow key, and on the contrary you can
clip this prefix with Left arrow key or Backspace key. To focus the next or
previous name with the same prefix, use Down or Up arrow key. To leave quick
search mode, use ESC key.
<P>

<A NAME="Selecting of Files and Directories">
<B>Selecting of Files and Directories</B><BR>
There are many ways how files and directories can be selected using the keyboard.
To select the focused file or directory, use Insert or Spacebar key. To select
names by the mask, use Num Plus key (numeric keypad). To unselect names by the
mask, use Num Minus key (numeric keypad). Masks can contain usual wild-card
characters - '*' for zero or more characters and '?' for any single character.
So the mask '*a?*' will match all names containing 'a' followed by at least one
character. To invert the selection, use Num Multiply key (numeric keypad). You
can choose if you want to include directories into select/unselect operations on
the tab General in the Configuration dialog. To select/unselect all the files
and directories, use Ctrl+Num Multiply key (use this key to clear the whole
selection).
<P>
There are also many ways to select files and directories using the mouse. You
can use the left mouse button with Shift key to select a group of files and
directories. Just move focus to (select) the first name in a group and then click on the
last. To select one file or directory, click the left mouse button with the Ctrl
key while on it. The right mouse button is used for selecting and for displaying
context menus. You can choose which of these actions will be primary on the tab
System in the Configuration dialog. The second action will be available on the
right mouse button with Ctrl key. To select or unselect one file or directory,
click the right mouse button while on it. To select or unselect group of files and
directories, press the right mouse button on the first, drag it, and release
it while on the last. Or click the right mouse button on the first and then click the
right mouse button with Shift key while on the last.
<P>

<A NAME="Files and Directories Operations">
<B>Files and Directories Operations</B><BR>
You can use standard Windows clipboard operations for the selected files and
directories. It means you can copy (Ctrl+C), cut (Ctrl+X), paste (Ctrl+V) and
paste shortcuts of files and directories. On the other hand, you can use also
standard MS-DOS ways of working with files and directories. To rename the
focused file or directory, use F2 key. To copy the selected files and
directories, use F5 key. You can choose if you want to clear the readonly file
attribute when copying from CD-ROM on the tab General in the Configuration
dialog. To move the selected files and directories, use F6 key. To delete the
selected files and directories, use F8 key or Delete key if the panel is focused
(focus is not in the system command line). If you use F8 or Delete key with
Shift modifier key, you will invert (flip) usage of Recycle Bin (if Delete key doesn't
send files to Recycle Bin, Shift+Delete key does and vice versa). To change
attributes of the selected files and directories, use Ctrl+F2 key (each
attribute is represented by one checkbox control with the following meaning -
checked = set it, unchecked = clear it, and third state = let it be). To create
the directory, use F7 key. You can also compress and uncompress files and
directories on NTFS volumes in Windows NT.
<P>
The current path from the second panel is automatically offered as a target
directory for copy and move operations. In addition to the target directory, you
can also specify the operation mask. Operation masks can contain special
characters - '*' for the rest of the name or the extension and '?' for a
single character. So the operation mask 'new_*.???' will generate names which
begin with 'new_' followed with the rest of the original name (from the fifth
character to the end), and end with '.' followed with three characters from the
original extension. Operation masks are usually used for simpler operations
like changing extensions in the group of files (you can use '*.html' for
renaming .htm files to .html files, etc.).
<P>
Some file operations which work with many files and directories can take several
minutes. Because of the time required, you can find useful to minimize all
program's windows during such operations. The operation progress will be
displayed in the taskbar. You can choose if you want to be warned by a system
beep when the operation finishes (on the tab General in the Configuration
dialog).
<P>

<A NAME="Drag and Drop Operations and Context Menus">
<B>Drag and Drop Operations and Context Menus</B><BR>
You can drag and drop files and directories from Servant Salamander to other
applications as well as back to Servant Salamander. Also you can drag and drop
files and directories from other applications to Servant Salamander. We use
standard cursor shapes, so you can easily distinguish among copying, moving,
and creating shortcuts. To choose from these actions, use appropriate combinations
of Shift and Ctrl modifier keys. You can also choose whether you want to confirm
every drag&drop operation or not (see the tab General in the Configuration
dialog).
<P>
The right mouse button is used for selecting of files and directories and for
displaying context menus. You can choose which of these actions will be primary
on the tab System in the Configuration dialog. The second action will be
available using the right mouse button with the Ctrl key. The context menus
are displayed for selected files and directories or for the focused file or
directory if there is no selection. To open the context menus with the keyboard,
use the Shift+F10 key.
<P>

<A NAME="Viewing and Editing">
<B>Viewing and Editing</B><BR>
To call the viewer for the focused file, use the F3 key. To call the alternate
viewer for the focused file, use the Alt+F3 key. To call the editor for the focused
file, use the F4 key. To call the editor for a new file, use the Shift+F4 key. The
viewer and editor to be used is selected on the tab Viewer/Editor in the
Configuration dialog. This tab is also used for specifying if the passing of
long file names to viewer and editor is possible (it is necessary to turn this
off if you are using an MS-DOS viewer or editor).
<P>

<A NAME="Internal Viewer">
<B>Internal Viewer</B><BR>
You can call the internal viewer for the focused file either with the F3 key or
Alt+F3 key (it depends on viewer settings). You can choose from two types of
view - a hex view (with F4 key in the viewer) and a text view (with F5 key in
the viewer). Each row in the hex view type contains 16 bytes displayed in two
ways - as hexadecimal numbers and as characters. Each row in the text view
contains one line of text ended by some of the defined line ends. You can
choose which line 'ends' should be used, in the internal viewer's Configuration
dialog. This dialog is also used for setting the tab character's width.
You can select a text by pressing, dragging and releasing of the left mouse
button. Then you can copy it into the clipboard. To find a text pattern, use
the F7 or Ctrl+F key. To find next or previous occurrence of the same text use the F6
key or Shift+F6 key. See the <A HREF="#Find Files">Find Files</A> paragraph for
details on pattern matching.
<P>

<A NAME="Find Files">
<B>Find Files</B><BR>
The Find Files dialog can be opened with Alt+F7 key. You can set criteria for
searching in this dialog. They include the search paths and masks, containing
text, and advanced search criteria. Each found file will be from one of the
search paths, will match the appropriate mask, will contain the selected text,
and will suit advanced search criteria. Advanced search criteria can be set in
the Advanced Find dialog (open it with the button Advanced). They include
required file attributes (each file attribute has one checkbox with the
following meaning - unchecked = must be cleared, checked = must be set, third
state = doesn't care). They include also required file size (size must be
smaller, greater, or equal to selected size) and required file last modification
time (this time must be older, newer, or equal to selected time). Change only
criteria which you want to use, the rest will be in predefined not used state.
<P>
When you finished settings, you can start searching with the Start button. To
stop searching, use ESC key or the Stop button. During and after searching, you
can view, edit, and use user-menu commands for found files. You can also execute
found files with Enter key or double-clicking the left mouse button. After
searching, you can focus the chosen found file in the active panel with Focus
button.
<P>
The searching may take a long time, and so you can, like during file operations,
minimize all windows of Servant Salamander. Operation results are then displayed
in the taskbar. You can choose if you want to be warned by the system beep when
searching finishes (on the tab General in the Configuration dialog).
<P>
The containing text can be specified by a simple text expression or by a regular
expression (Regular expression checkbox checked). The simple text expression can
be set in a text or in a hexadecimal mode (HEX-mode checkbox checked). The text
mode is obvious and the hexadecimal mode can be used to set character by
character in hexadecimal numbers. You can also input normal text in the
hexadecimal mode, but it must be quoted using double quotes. So if you set
'01 02 "text" 00', it will be a pattern with 7 characters, 2+4+1. The regular
expressions are much more powerful then the simple text expressions, you can
use them to find texts, which have specified attributes. These attributes are
for example "pattern begins at the beginning of line", "pattern ends at the end
of line", "pattern starts with some prefix and ends with some suffix", "pattern
is one word from a set of words", "pattern contains only characters from some
character sequence (e.g. numbers)".
<P>
Here is a short guide to regular expressions:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>'^' - at the start of the expression matches the start of a line (for example,
          '^test' matches all strings 'test' placed at the start of a line)
<LI>'$' - at the end of the expression matches the end of a line
<LI>'.' - matches any character
<LI>'*' - after an expression matches 0 or more matches for the expression
          (for example, 'ad*' matches 'a', 'ad', and as well as 'add' - in other
           words, 'a' followed by any number of 'd')
<LI>'+' - after an expression matches 1 or more matches for the expression
          (for example, 'do+' matches 'do' and as well as 'doo' - in other words,
           'd' followed by at least one 'o')
<LI>'?' - after an expression matches 0 or 1 match for the expression
          (for example, 'add?' matches 'ad' and 'add' - in other words, 'ad'
           followed by optional 'd')
<LI>'|' - between expressions matches match for first, match for second, etc.
        (for example, 'red|blue|black' matches 'red', 'blue', and 'black'
         - in other words, any of mentioned words)
<LI>'[ ]' - characters in brackets match any one character that appears in the
          brackets, but no others (for example, 'a[dts]' matches 'ad', 'at',
          and 'as' - in other words, 'a' followed by 'd', 't', or 's')
<LI>'[^ ]' - characters in brackets match any one character that doesn't appear in
           the brackets, but no others (for example, '[^abc]' matches any
           character except 'a', 'b', and 'c')
<LI>'[-]' - signifies a range of characters (for example, '1[0-9]' matches all
            numbers in range '10' to '19')
<LI>'( )' - glues expressions in parentheses to one expression (for example,
            '(very )*well' matches 'well', 'very well', and as well as
            'very very well' - in other words, any number of 'very ' followed
            by 'well')
<LI>'\' - before any character matches this character (for example 'too\.'
          matches only 'too.', note that 'too.' matches 'tool', 'took', and
          as well as 'toon' - in other words, 'too' followed by any character)
</UL>
<P>
The following, complete description of regular expressions is taken from
documentation for the REGEXP library, which is a great work of Henry Spencer.
<P>
REGULAR EXPRESSION SYNTAX<BR>
A regular expression is zero or more branches, separated by '|'.  It matches
anything that matches one of the branches.
<P>
A branch is zero or more pieces, concatenated.  It matches a match for the first,
followed by a match for the second, etc.
<P>
A piece is an atom possibly followed by '*', '+', or '?'. An atom followed by
'*' matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom.  An atom followed by
'+' matches a sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom.  An atom followed by
'?' matches a match of the atom, or the null string.
<P>
An atom is a regular expression in parentheses (matching a match for the regular
expression), a range (see below), '.' (matching any single character), '^'
(matching the null string at the beginning of line), '$' (matching the null
string at the end of line), a '\' followed by a single character (matching that
character), or a single character with no other significance (matching that
character).
<P>
A range is a sequence of characters enclosed in '[]'. It normally matches any
single character from the sequence. If the sequence begins with '^', it matches
any single character not from the rest of the sequence.  If two characters in
the sequence are separated by '-', this is shorthand for the full list of ASCII
characters between them (e.g. '[0-9]' matches any decimal digit).  To include a
literal ']' in the sequence, make it the first character (following a possible
'^').  To include a literal '-', make it the first or last character.
<P>
AMBIGUITY<BR>
If a regular expression could match two different parts of the text, it will
match the one which begins earliest.  If both begin in the same place but match
different lengths, or match the same length in different ways, life gets
messier, as follows.
<P>
In general, the possibilities in a list of branches are considered in
left-to-right order, the possibilities for '*', '+', and '?' are considered
longest-first, nested constructs are considered from the outermost in, and
concatenated constructs are considered leftmost-first.  The match that will be
chosen is the one that uses the earliest possibility.
<P>
For example, '(ab|a)b*c' could match 'abc' in one of two ways. The first choice
is between 'ab' and 'a'; since 'ab' is earlier, and does lead to a successful
overall match, it is chosen.  Since the 'b' is already spoken for, the 'b*' must
match its last possibility-the empty string-since it must respect the earlier
choice.
<P>
In the particular case where no '|'s are present and there is only one '*', '+',
or '?', the net effect is that the longest possible match will be chosen.  So
'ab*', presented with 'xabbbby', will match 'abbbb'.  Note that if 'ab*' is
tried against 'xabyabbbz', it will match 'ab' just after 'x', due to the
begins-earliest rule.
<P>

<A NAME="Hot Paths">
<B>Hot Paths</B><BR>
Hot paths are used to access frequently visited directories. There are twenty
hotkeys for ten hot paths, ten for defining and ten for getting to the defined
hot path. To define the current directory as the hot path, use Shift+Ctrl+number
key, where number is 0 to 9. To get to the defined hot path, use Ctrl+number
key or menu Commands/Go to Hot Path. You can also define hot paths from the tab
Hot Paths in the Configuration dialog.
<P>

<A NAME="User Menu">
<B>User Menu</B><BR>
The user menu is a list of user menu items. Each item contains an item title, a
command, and item execution flags. The item title is used for displaying in the
User Menu dialog. The command will be executed after choosing an item. Commands
can contain predefined variables which will be expanded before execution. These
variables are parts of a full filenames of selected files and directories:
<DD><LI>%d - the drive (e.g. 'c:')</DD>
<DD><LI>%p - the long path name (e.g. '\Program Files\Microsoft Internet\')</DD>
<DD><LI>%h - the short path name (e.g. '\PROGRA~1\MICROS~1\')</DD>
<DD><LI>%f - the long file name (e.g. 'read this file.txt')</DD>
<DD><LI>%s - the short file name (e.g. 'READTH~1.TXT')</DD>
<DD><LI>%% - the character '%' (if you need to use the character '%')</DD>
<P>
The item flags are used for choosing a type of the execution. These types are a
direct execution and an execution through the system shell (with and without
closing the shell window after execution). The direct execution is good for
windowed applications. The executing through the system shell is usable for
console oriented applications with some interesting output and for execution
queues (pipes, redirected input and output, etc.).
<P>
You can define the user menu on the tab User Menu in the Configuration dialog.
This tab is a little bit complicated. There are buttons for adding, modifying,
and deleting of the user menu items. The focused item is parsed into the item
name, the command, and the execution flags. After modifying these parsed data,
you must use the button Modify to modify the user menu item. To change the
order of the user menu items, use Ctrl+Up and Ctrl+Down keys in the listview
control Menu Items.
<P>
You can open the User Menu dialog with the list of the user menu items from the
panels and from the Find Files dialog with F9 key.
<P>

<A NAME="Restoring Network Connections">
<B>Restoring Network Connections</B><BR>
If some network connection is not accessible during the logon operation, the
system temporarily disables this connection. To restore such a network
connection, just change the drive to the appropriate disabled network volume
with Alt+F1 or Alt+F2 key. If the network volume becomes inaccessible during
work, and you'll try to access it, it may take a long time to the system to
recognize this error. If this occurs, you can press ESC key to continue with
the Servant Salamander (waiting for the system error runs in a separate thread).
<P>

<A NAME="Comparing Directories">
<B>Comparing Directories</B><BR>
The command Compare Directories is in the menu Commands. With this command you
can compare contents of current directories in the left and the right panel.
After comparing, files that are not present in the other panel and files that
are newer or bigger will be selected in both panels.
<P>

<A NAME="Changing Case of Names">
<B>Changing Case of Names</B><BR>
The command Change Case is in the menu Files. With this command you can change
case of the selected directory (including subdirectories or not) and file names
to lower, upper, and mixed case. This is usable when you need to transfer files
and directories from a case-insensitive file system to a case-sensitive file
system.
<P>

<A NAME="Using Recycle Bin">
<B>Using Recycle Bin</B><BR>
You can enable deleting files and directories through the system Recycle Bin.
This allows you to recover deleted files and directories. You can use the
system Recycle Bin for all files and directories or only for files that match
at least one of specified masks. By specifying the masks you can distinguish
between important files (e.g. your text documents and your source codes) and
files which you can easily restore from other sources (e.g. executables,
libraries, or system files). Whether use the system Recycle Bin or not can be
set on the tab System in the Configuration dialog.
<P>

<A NAME="Command line parameters of Salamand.exe">
<B>Command line parameters of Salamand.exe</B><BR>
You can specify current directories in panels after execution of Servant
Salamander. These directories can be passed to Salamand.exe as first and second
command line parameter. So 'Salamand.exe "C:\Program Files" D:\' will execute
Servant Salamander with "C:\Program Files" in the left panel and "D:\" in the
right panel.
<P>

<A NAME="Other Useful Commands">
<B>Other Useful Commands</B><BR>
You can get detailed information about the current drive or network volume
with the command Drive Information from the menu Commands. If the system
associations were changed, you need to refresh cached associations in Servant
Salamander. You can do this by restarting Servant Salamander or by the command
Reread Associations from the menu Commands. You can open special folders
like My Computer, Recycle Bin, Control Panel, or Network Neighborhood directly
from Salamander using the submenu Open Folder from the menu Commands.
<P>

<A NAME="Defined Hotkeys">
<B>Defined Hotkeys</B><BR>
There are many hotkeys defined in Servant Salamander. These can speed up your
work with files and directories. You can find all the functions, also, in a menu
together with associated hotkey.
