<B>Q</B>: Does Servant Salamander run on Windows 3.x with Win32s?
<BR>
<B>A</B>: No. Servant Salamander is a native Win32 application and uses API
functions which are not supported under Win32s.
<P>

<B>Q</B>: Does Servant Salamander run on Windows NT 3.51?
<BR>
<B>A</B>: No. This old NT system doesn't support functions used in new version
of Servant Salamander. If you have this system, you can use version 1.4,
but some new shell features like drag&drop won't certainly work.
<P>

<B>Q</B>: Where can I get the latest version of Servant Salamander?
<BR>
<B>A</B>: The latest version will be always available on this site. We will also
do our best to upload the latest versions to all important Windows FTP sites.
See page mirrors and other links.
<P>

<B>Q</B>: Why commands Compress and Uncompress don't work?
<BR>
<B>A</B>: These commands provide support for a file-based compression (not ARJ,
ZIP, RAR, etc.). The file-based compression must be supported directly by a file
system. FAT doesn't support it, NTFS (NT File System) supports it. So these
commands will work on NTFS formated disks.
<P>

<B>Q</B>: What's the function of a checkbox "Use advanced graphic features" on
the tab General in the Configuration dialog?
<BR>
<B>A</B>: If you check it, Salamander will use a memory bitmap to draw items
to panels. It means that each item will be completed outside the screen and
then will be moved to the screen. So panels are repainted much smoother.
Disadvantage of this method is its speed (two times slower).
<P>

<B>Q</B>: What's the function of a checkbox "Set Find in internal viewer to
search grepped text from the Find Files dialog" on the tab Viewer/Editor in
the Configuration dialog?
<BR>
<B>A</B>: When you press F3 key in the Find Files dialog at some found file, and
you are using internal viewer, do you want to set the Find dialog in internal
viewer to search the same text as the Find Files dialog (edit control Containing
Text)?
<BR>
In other words, when you turn on this option, you can find the text
quickly using F6 key in internal viewer.
<P>

<B>Q</B>: How can I format or copy floppy disks?
<BR>
<B>A</B>: Open the menu with available drives (Alt+F1/F2) and open the context
menu for desired floppy disk drive (click the right mouse button or use
Shift+F10 key). You can choose "Format..." or "Copy Disk..." from this menu.
